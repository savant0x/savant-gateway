distinguish verified behavior from unverified claims.

## 2026-10-29 — Savant Gateway repository bootstrap

- **FID-2026-1029-002 — high — Establish the Savant Gateway identity and
  repository scaffold.** The product surface is renamed from the resale
  scaffold to Savant Gateway; `lib/apinex.ts` becomes `lib/provider.ts`;
  provider endpoint variables become `PROVIDER_BASE_URL` and
  `PROVIDER_PUBLIC_MODELS_URL` with the existing upstream defaults. The
  929-line dashboard and 471-line store are split into responsibility-scoped
  modules under the 400-line ceiling. Adds AGENTS/ECHO/protocol governance,
  FID and session templates, the attribution guard, quality gate, Node test
  suite, git hooks, and CI. No provider behavior, key format, free-pool rule,
  or metering rule changed. Closed against commit
  `bf3da9a007ca41d6e66c60ed080c2ef3e6cef7e5`; the FID is archived at
  `dev/fids/archive/FID-2026-1029-002-savant-gateway-bootstrap.md`.
